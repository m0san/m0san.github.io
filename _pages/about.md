I'm a Research Assistant Intern at Oracle Casablance studying Computer Science at 1337FIL. I'm a hard worker, I set high goals and I've been told that I am persistent. I really do believe tech can help people and the planet as a whole if done right.

. I have the following interests:

- Machine Learning and Deep Learning
- Blockchain
- Learn more about Data Structures and Algorithms
